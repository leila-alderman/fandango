    "# Fandango Movie Rating Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In October 2015, Walt Hickey of FiveThirtyEight [published an article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) in which he analyzed data on Fandango's website to show that the movie rating website was artifically inflating its star ratings. His analysis compared the star rating displayed on the website to the actual rating that he was able to find in website's HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    " - For 32% of movies, Fandango increased the rating by 0.3 or 0.4 stars by rounding up when you would normally round down.\n",
    " - For 8% of movies, Fandango added an entire half-star to the rating, showing a 4.5 star rating as 5 stars.\n",
    " - In one case, a movie's rating was inflated by an entire star, increasing its actual rating of 4 to 5 stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "In response to questions from Hickey, Fandango replied that the overly generous ratings were the result of a \"software glitch\" that would be fixed \"as soon as possible\". Three years after this article was published, this fix has presumably already been implemented. However, we can't tell for sure since the actual rating value is no longer included in the HTML for Fandango's pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis."

The [data for this article](https://github.com/mircealex/Movie_ratings_2016_17) includes movie ratings for 2016 and 2017 and will be used to examine the Fandango rating system after the Hickey's article was published."

    "To determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system since Hickey's analysis, the population of interest is every movie that has been rated by Fandango prior to Hickey's analysis and in the time since. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to the article, the data from Hickey includes all movies that had at least 30 fan reviews on Fandango and had tickets for sale in 2015. However, there appears to be some sort of discrepency in the data: the articles states that 209 films fit these sampling parameters, whereas the DataFrame above contains only 146 rows. The data from Olteanu contains data for the 214 most reviewed movies released in 2016 and 2017. The actual parameters used to determine which movies were \"most reviewed\" are not given. \n",
    "\n",
    "This sampling clearly isn't random. Part of the analysis for both of the articles was to compare movie ratings from multiple websites. As a result, this sampling method was used to select movies that have stable reviews from a sufficiently large number of users, omitting movies that have only a few ratings that are therefore likely to be highly skewed. Since the goal of the current analysis is to compare published Fandango ratings to the internal Fandango ratings, there is no need to limit the sample based on the number of user reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the temporal bounds on the sampling were most likely selected for ease of use and relevancy. Olteanu specifically addressed the temporal bounds on his sampling in [his article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/whose-reviews-should-you-trust-imdb-rotten-tomatoes-metacritic-or-fandango-7d1010c6cf19): \"I havenâ€™t collected ratings for movies released before 2016, simply because a slight change has occurred in Fandangoâ€™s rating system soon after Walt Hickeyâ€™s analysis...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Because these samples do not fully encompass the desired population for the goal stated above, we can either collect new data or alter the goal of this analysis; the latter is a much faster option and the one we'll select here. Based on the available data, **the new goal of this analysis is to examine any differences between Fandango ratings for popular movies released in 2015 (prior to Hickey's article) and those for popular movies released in 2016 (after Hickey's article)**. We'll omit any movies that were released in 2017 due to their unreliability based on the following note in the [README](https://github.com/mircealex/Movie_ratings_2016_17) for Olteanu's data: \"As of March 22, 2017, the ratings were up to date. Significant changes should be expected mostly for movies released in 2017.\""
